Example Implementation in Node.js
Here is a simple example of how you might structure the User Management API using Express.js in Node.js:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Mock database
let users = [];

// Register endpoint
app.post('/register', (req, res) => {
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    if (!username || !password) {
        return res.status(400).send('Username and password are required');
    }
    const user = { id: users.length + 1, username, password };
    users.push(user);
    res.status(201).send(user);
});

// Login endpoint
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    const user = users.find(u => u.username === username && u.password === password);
    if (!user) {
        return res.status(401).send('Invalid credentials');
    }
    res.send({ message: 'Login successful', user });
});

// Profile endpoint
app.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
    // In a real application, you would use a session or token to get the user
    const user = users[0]; // Mock: always return the first user
    res.send(user);
});

// Start the server
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
Next Steps
Design the database schema: Plan out how the data will be stored in your database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
Implement additional APIs: Following a similar structure, implement the rest of the APIs.
Add authentication and authorization: Use JWT or OAuth for securing your endpoints.
Build the frontend: Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
Test and deploy: Ensure thorough testing and deploy your application to a reliable server.
